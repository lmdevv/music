/**
 * Selecting the Search tab opens its field with the keyboard up (A13, A17 · 03), as Apple Music
 * does: the tab bar becomes the search field and searching starts at once. The tab bar reports the
 * selection here and the Search screen focuses its field, so the field's close circle leaves the
 * results on screen rather than returning to the previous tab, as UISearchTab's own activation
 * does. On an iPad the sidebar's Search row asks instead, and may do so before the Search tab has
 * ever mounted, so its request waits, and the screen's field opens focused.
