/**
 * Now Playing (B01 local, B02 remote, H05 dark): the cover, the song, the scrubber, the controls,
 * the volume, and where the music plays. The background takes the cover's color. Tapping the
 * cover opens the lyrics (B12, H13) when the song has them, and the queue button opens the queue
 * (B03, H06), in place, as Apple Music does: the cover shrinks into the corner of a row with the
 * song's title, and the queue or the lyrics rise under it. The queue keeps every control below
 * it; the lyrics keep only the scrubber and the transport (B12–B14). One of the two shows at a
 * time. With nothing queued it says so (G14).
 *
 * On an iPhone it is a native sheet over the tabs that the person drags down to dismiss (B11); the
 * sliders keep their own drags. On an iPad it fills the window at every width (Paper page 25) and
 * the app owns the dismissal: dragging the handle or the player down, tapping the handle, or
 * VoiceOver's escape. There the player is a centered column with a larger cover (P07), and in a
 * wide window on its side the queue and the lyrics leave the cover for a pane beside the player,
 * with a lyrics button in the bottom row (P08, P09, P11). `partsOf` decides what each width shows.
