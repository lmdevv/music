        Host folders mounted read-only for the library. A list mounts each folder at

        store these in-container paths, so keep a mount's name once a library uses it. The media
        service reads the folders as `uid`/`gid`, so their files must be readable by that user
        (world-readable 644 files and 755 folders are).
