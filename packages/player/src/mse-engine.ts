/**
 * The gapless engine: every song is a fragmented MP4 stream (`fmp4-flac` or `fmp4-aac`) appended
 * into one `SourceBuffer` of one `MediaSource`, laid end to end on a single timeline. Each song's
 * `timestampOffset` shifts its encoder priming in front of its slot and the append window cuts
 * priming and padding, so the decoder plays one continuous stream with no gap and no overlap.
 *
 * One pump appends at a time, in song order: the current song, then the preloaded one. It reads
 * each response as it streams, stays at most `AHEAD_SECONDS` ahead of the playhead (the HTTP
 * stream waits meanwhile; less when the browser's buffer quota runs out first, as Firefox's does
 * for hi-res FLAC), and evicts what lies more than `BEHIND_SECONDS` behind it. Seeking
 * outside the buffer drops everything and restarts the song from the fragment the `sidx` points
 * at with a range request.
 *
 * A song the media service is still transcoding arrives as it is encoded, with an estimated
 * length and no `sidx` (see `StreamTimingHeader.estimated`). The engine appends it as it comes
 * but holds back its last two fragments (`held-tail.ts`); when the stream ends it asks for the
 * exact length, narrows the append window, and only then appends the end. Seeking outside the
 * buffer of such a song (or loading it part-way) opens a stream the media service encodes from
 * the target at once (`&start=`, see `stream-offset.ts`): its fragments sit on the song's own
 * timeline, so they append at the song's usual place, behind their own init segment and an append
 * window that starts at the stream's first sample. The exact length then comes from the full
 * transcode, which a `HEAD` request asks for as soon as the offset stream opens.
 *
 * A stream cut off before its song's end (dropped, ended early, or silent while the playhead
 * waits) is picked up where its appends stopped, the same way as a seek, up to
 * `MAX_RECOVERIES` times in a row without progress.
 *
 * A codec change between songs (FLAC to AAC) uses `SourceBuffer.changeType`. Browsers without it
 * finish the current song and reset the `MediaSource` for the next one, with a short gap.
