description: Control a [music] server (the user's self-hosted music library) from the terminal with the `music` CLI. Use when asked to find, play, queue, like, or organize music, manage playlists, move playback between devices, add or rescan library folders, or manage API keys, invites, and people on a [music] server.

# [music] CLI

`music` runs every action the [music] app has. Each one is a command in a shared registry, so the
CLI, the web app, and this skill always agree.

## Setup

1. Get an API key: in the web app open Settings → API keys, or run `music keys create --name agent`
   from a machine that is already logged in. The key is shown once.
2. Log in with the Convex URL of the server. On the container install that is
   `https://<host>/convex`:

   ```sh
   music login --server https://music.example.com/convex --key mk_...
   music whoami
   ```

   `login` checks the key, then stores `{ server, key }` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/music/config.json`
   (mode 0600). `MUSIC_SERVER` and `MUSIC_API_KEY` override the file, which suits CI and sandboxes.
   `music logout` deletes the stored key and the cached session.

## How it works

- `music <group> <command> [flags]` runs registry command `<group>.<command>`; `music search` runs
  `search`. Flags come from the command's argument schema: `trackIds` is `--track-ids`.
- When a command needs one value, it can go first without its flag:
  `music playlists get <playlist-id>`, `music search daft punk`, `music queue add <id> <id>`.
- Lists take repeated flags or commas: `--track-ids a,b` equals `--track-ids a --track-ids b`.
  Booleans are `--liked` or `--no-liked`. `--args '<json>'` passes the whole argument object.
- IDs are opaque strings from earlier results. Never invent them; read them from `--json` output.
- Add `--json` to parse results. It prints the decoded result on stdout. Errors go to stderr as
  `{"error":{"code","message"}}`. Without `--json`, lists print as tables with an `ID` column.
- Commands marked as jobs (library scans) return a `jobId` at once. Add `--wait` to poll until the
  job ends; progress goes to stderr. With `--json` the output is `{ "result", "job" }`. `--timeout
  <seconds>` (default 3600) bounds the wait.
- `music commands --json` lists every command with its flags and its arguments as JSON Schema.
  `music <command> --help` shows one command.
- Admin-only commands fail with exit code 3 and `forbidden` for other users.

## Recipes

Find and play an album:

```sh
music play abbey road            # best match: album, artist's top songs, or songs
music search "abbey road" --json # or choose yourself: .albums[].id
music albums get <album-id> --json
music playback play --track-ids <id>,<id>,<id>
music now
```

Make a playlist from search results:

```sh
ids=$(music search "miles davis" --limit 10 --json | jq -r '[.tracks[].id] | join(",")')
music playlists create "Late night" --track-ids "$ids" --json   # → {"playlistId": ...}
music playlists add --playlist-id <playlist-id> --track-ids <id>
```

Like the current song:

```sh
id=$(music now --json | jq -r '.queue[.index].id')
music likes set "$id" --liked
```

Move playback to another device. The list leaves out devices silent for over a day, except the
one playing:

```sh
music devices list               # find the device ID; online devices can play
music playback transfer <device-id>
```

Add a library folder and wait for the scan (admin):

```sh
music libraries create --name Music --path /srv/music --wait
music libraries scan <library-id> --wait --timeout 600
```

Invite someone (admin):

```sh
music invites create --email friend@example.com --json   # share .code with them
```

Playback controls: `music pause`, `music resume`, `music next`, `music previous`,
`music playback seek <ms>`, `music playback volume 0.5`, `music playback shuffle --on`,
`music playback repeat all`, `music queue add <id> --next`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                                   | What to do                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Success                                                   |                                           |
| 1    | The command failed (`not_found`, `conflict`, job failure) | Read `error.code` and `error.message`     |
| 2    | Usage error: unknown command, missing flag, invalid value | Fix the command; see `music <cmd> --help` |
| 3    | Auth error: not logged in, bad key, or admin-only command | `music login`, a new key, or an admin key |

## Troubleshooting

- `not_logged_in`: run `music login`, or set both `MUSIC_SERVER` and `MUSIC_API_KEY`.
- `invalid_key`: the key was revoked or mistyped. Create a new one.
- `server_error` with "Could not reach": check the URL. It is the Convex URL (`.../convex`), not
  the web app URL.
- `timeout` from `--wait`: the job is still running. Check it with `music jobs get <job-id>`. A job
  stuck in `pending` means the media service is not running.
- Playback commands change the shared session. A device must be online to play; `music now` shows
  the active device.
